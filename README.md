# 🧠 Multimodal RAG System with Multi-Agent Architecture (In Progress)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores a **Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system
based on a **multi-agent architecture**. The goal is to improve AI responses by
combining document retrieval, multimodal reasoning (text & image), and agent coordination.

⚠️ This project is currently **in progress** and focuses on architecture design,
experimentation, and research exploration.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- Router Agent: dispatches user queries to specialized agents
- Text Agent: handles text-based retrieval and generation
- Image Agent: processes visual inputs (future extension)
- Retriever Agent: retrieves relevant documents from vector databases
- LLM: generates final responses using retrieved context
---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- NLP & Embeddings
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector Databases (FAISS / Chroma – planned)
- Multi-Agent Systems (Agentic AI)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧪 Current Status
✔️ Architecture design  
✔️ Initial RAG pipeline (text-based)  
✔️ Agent role definition  
🚧 Multimodal integration (image + text)  
🚧 Agent orchestration & optimization  

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Full multimodal retrieval (text + image)
- Advanced agent communication
- Evaluation metrics for RAG performance
- Integration with LLM APIs

---

## 📚 Motivation
This project is part of an academic exploration of **Agentic AI, RAG systems,
and multimodal reasoning**, aligned with current research trends in AI systems.
